## emphisis

The cat (*Felis catus*), also referred to as the domestic cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family *Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the* Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.*It is valued by humans* for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable _claws are adapted to killing_ small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, *flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell* are *well developed.* It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting—as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

## bold

Female domestic **cats** can have **kittens** from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and **throughout the year in equatorial regions,** with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic **cats** are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed **cats**, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their **proliferation and the abandonment** of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral **cats** worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.
